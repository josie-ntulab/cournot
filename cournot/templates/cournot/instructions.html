    </h3>

    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        Each of you will represent a firm. Both firms manufacture the same product.
	There will be {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds. Now is the <b> {{player.round_number}} / {{Constants.num_rounds}} </b> round.
    </p>

    <p>
        The two of you decide simultaneously and independently how many units to manufacture.
	Your choices can be any natural number. <!-- from 0 to {{ Constants.max_units_per_player }}.-->
	<!-- All produced units will be sold, but the more is produced, the lower the unit selling price will be. -->
        The market price will be determine by the outputs combined, and you will know your own profit after each round.
    </p>


    <!--<p>
        The unit selling price is:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <strong>Unit selling price = {{ Constants.total_capacity }} – Units produced by your firm – Units produced by the other firm</strong>
    </ul>
    -->

    <p>
        Your unit cost is {{ player.cost }} per unit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your profit is:
    </p>

    <ul>
	    <strong>Your profit = Market unit selling price × Units produced by your firm - Your unit cost × Units produced by your firm </strong>
    </ul>

    <p>
    	In order to help you make a decision, the history of your decision and profit will be presented below.
    </p>
